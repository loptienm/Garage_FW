Garage Control System
Created by Mike Loptien in 2013 in Longmont Colorado
=========

This is an Arduino based project utilizing a Spark Core to control a home garage.  This will be able to open and close the garage door via WIFI over the Internet with the Spark Core, tell the open/closed status of the garage door via a reed switch, and sense the approach of a car and tell the driver to continue foward, slow down, or stop using an RGB LED and a range finder.  Other features may come later.

This code will live on spark.io/build to be flashed wirelessly to the Spark but will need version control on GitHub.
